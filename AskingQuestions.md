## How to Ask a Good Question

Please refrain from asking questions along the lines of *"My code doesn't compile! Please help!"* Doing so will decrease the chance that the instructor, TAs, or even fellow students will help. Instead, try to be as specific as possible. Use the suggestions outlined in [Stack Overflow How to Ask](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/advice?) for tips on asking good questions.

Questions posted on an Issues Page about **homework** will not be answered, and will be deleted, unless they adhere to the following format:

```
(Title) (Provide in Issue Title)

# Description

(A short description of the problem.)

# Attempted Fixes

(Describe what you did while attempting to fix the problem.)

# Error Message(s)

(Verbatim copy the compile or runtime error messages here. If there are no
errors but there is incorrect output, provide the test that you used to
determine that the output is incorrect as well as a plot, if applicable.)
```

Questions about lecture material or high performance computing subject matter in general need not adhere to this specific format but should be descriptive and follow the suggestions in [Stack Overflow How to Ask](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/advice?).

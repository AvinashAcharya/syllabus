## How to Ask a Good Question

Please refrain from asking questions along the lines of *"My code doesn't compile! Please help!"* Doing so will decrease your chances that the instructor, TAs, or even fellow students will help. Instead, try to be as specific as possible. Use the suggestions outlined in [Stack Overflow How to Ask](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/advice?) for tips on asking good questions.

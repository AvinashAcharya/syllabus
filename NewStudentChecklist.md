# New Student Checklist

The following is a list of tools and accounts you will need for this course. Please make sure you set up these accounts as soon as possible.

* [GitHub](http://www.github.com) account: we will use GitHub for accessing and
  submitting homework assignments
* [SageMathCloud](http://cloud.sagemath.com) account: to avoid having to install a
  wide variety of programming tools (languages, compilers, IDEs, etc.) we will
  use SageMathCloud as out computing environment.
  * Begin by making a free account. You are allocated a single (shared) core,
    1 GB RAM, and 3 GB disk space, and no internet access. (e.g. no git)
  * Shortly after the start of the course you will be asked to pay a (small)
    fee which will grant you access to multiple cores, RAM, and disk space.
  * Until the fee is paid you will be able to use Git locally on SageMathCloud but
    you won't be able to clone, pull, or push to repos.
* Make sure you can access the canvas webpage: https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1038251
  * Weekly quizzes will be posted here as well as course announcements.

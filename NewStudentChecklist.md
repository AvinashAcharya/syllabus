# New Student Checklist

The following is a list of tools and accounts you will need for this course. Please make sure you set up these accounts as soon as possible and send us your account information using the Google Form link at the bottom of this document.

* [GitHub](http://www.github.com) account: we will use GitHub for accessing and
  submitting homework assignments
* [SageMathCloud](http://cloud.sagemath.com) account: to avoid having to install a
  wide variety of programming tools (languages, compilers, IDEs, etc.) we will
  use SageMathCloud as out computing environment.
  * Begin by making a free account. You are allocated a single (shared) core,
    1 GB RAM, and 3 GB disk space, and no internet access. (e.g. no git)
  * Shortly after the start of the course you will be asked to pay a (small)
    fee which will grant you access to multiple cores, RAM, and disk space as well
    as the ability to clone, push, and pull repos using git.
  * Until the fee is paid you will be able to use Git locally on SageMathCloud but
    you won't be able to clone, pull, or push to repos.
* Make sure you can access the canvas webpage: https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1038251
  * Weekly quizzes will be posted here as well as course announcements.

## Very Important Final Step

Once you've created your SageMathCloud and GitHub account please let us know your
account names by filling out the Google Form at this link:

Doing so is necessary for two things:

1. the instructor and TAs to be able to grade your homework,
2. granting you access to the upgraded SageMathCloud environment.

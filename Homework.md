# Homework

Here we describe how to obtain and submit the software portion of the bi-weekly homework.

## Submission Process Overview

In this section we describe how to properly obtain a personal, private copy of the assignment respository using Classrooms for GitHub.

1. **Follow the Invitation Link** The instructor will send out a link to the assignment. The link will look something like this: https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/fed4a4bece59804c6f448ad6b4278050 ***(Please do not follow this link since a finite number of private assignment repositories have been allocated.)***
2. **Accept the Assignment** A webpage will open where GitHub will request that you accept the assignment. Click *"Accept this assignment"* so that your personal (and private) repository can be created. ![Step 2](images/assignment-2.png)
3. **Allow GitHub Permission to Access Information** (This may occur.) In order for the assignment to be created Classroom for GitHub needs access to some of the information posted in your GitHub account.
4. **Confirmation** You should receive confirmation that a copy of the assignment has been created for you as well as a link to the assignment repository. ![Step 4](images/assignment-4.png)
5. **Your Assignment Repository** Following the link on the confirmation page will take you to your assignment repository. It is essential that you push your changes to this repository and no other assignment repository. For example, you cannot create a separate, public fork of your own. For one, this violates the [academic integrity rules](https://github.com/uwhpsc-2016/syllabus/blob/master/Grading.md). Second, our method for collecting homework will not detect any repositories made outside of the Classroom for GitHub setting. Finally, note that this repo is private to yourself, the instructor, and teaching assistants. ![Step 5](images/assignment-5.png)
6. **Complete the assignment** Read this document, our [grading policy](https://github.com/uwhpsc-2016/syllabus/blob/master/Grading.md), as well as the information in the [example homework assignment](https://github.com/uwhpsc-2016/example-python-homework) for details on how to complete the assignment.
7. **Submission** Make sure the final version work is pushed to your private repository by Monday, 5:00pm PST of the day the homework is due. It will be automatically collected at this time. Any late work is not accepted under any circumstances.

## Homework Format

See the [Grading Policy]() document for information on how homework is formatted. We will practice in class how to submit homework.
